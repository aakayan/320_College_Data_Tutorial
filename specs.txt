Questions:
    Which states have the highest in-state tuitions?
        Do these correllate to the highest revenue gained from tuition fees?
            if not-- maybe do principal component analysis to see what the high tuitions correspond most to?
        How do the racial demographics of colleges in these states look?
        Does the cost of tuition relate to the percentage of stem vs humanities degrees awarded?
