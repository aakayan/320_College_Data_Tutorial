# 320_College_Data_Tutorial

Hey guys, here's a quick tutorial on data science. This only scratches the surface of what you can do, but hopefully it provides a good introduction to many of the features that are available.

The tutorial can be viewed under "final.ipynb". "ipynb" is a notebook document created through Jupyter Notebooks, so in order to actually run the code yourself, you would need to download and set that up. In order to get that working, you'll need to download Python and then Jupyter Notebooks.
